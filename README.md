News Summary Challenge
======================
Create an app that grabs all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and displays them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

Objectives of exercise
----
- Build a single page web app, written purely in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML. No libraries or frameworks!
- Use a static web server (e.g. [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) to serve the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.
- Send requests to an API to get data from the Guardian and to summarise text.
